.SH HISTORY
Sopwith was originally designed as a demonstration game for the Imaginet
Networking System developed by BMB CompuScience of Canada. The system
failed to become popular but Sopwith became a popular game for the IBM
PC and compatibles. A sequel "Sopwith 2" was actually a newer version
rather than a different game, but included many extra features, such
as Oxen and birds. Sopwith was also ported to the Atari. The 
original author, David L. Clark, later created Sopwith - The Author's
Edition with several extra features including missiles. This version of
sopwith is based on the source for the Authors Edition.
